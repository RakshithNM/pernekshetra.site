is traditionally used for its therapeutic properties. Ayurvedic 
practitioners utilize Durva for its Kapha-balancing effects, 
making it beneficial for respiratory conditions associated with 
excess Kapha dosha. With recognized anti-inflammatory 
properties, it finds application in formulations aimed at 
addressing inflammatory conditions, including arthritis. 
Durva is also valued in Ayurveda for its potential role in wound 
healing and promoting digestive health. Additionally, it is 
incorporated into formulations that aim to support heart health 
and manage blood sugar levels, 
reflecting its diverse traditional uses in Ayurvedic medicine.",,,,
