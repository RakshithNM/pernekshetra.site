            Ananthapura Lake Temple is a Hindu temple located in the middle of a lake in the Kasaragod District of Kerala, South India, at around 6 km from Kumbala. This is the only lake temple in Kerala and is believed to be the original seat (Moolasthana) of Ananthapadmanabha Swami Padmanabhaswamy temple) Thiruvananthapuram. Legend has it that this is the original site where Ananthapadmanabha settled down. The temple's lake is also home to a crocodile named "Babiya", which is supposed to be the guard of the temple. When one dies, another mysteriously takes its place. The Temple lake or tank in which the Sanctum is situated is a large structure measuring 302 feet square (about 2 acres).
          </p>
          <p>
            There is a cave to the right corner of the lake, which has a gate. According to the priests of the temple, god AnanthaPadmanabha went to Thiruvananthapuram through that cave. Hence the names of both the places are a bit similar. Also there is a difference in the God idols places in both the temples. the one in Ananthapuram is standing idol and the other in Thiruvananthapuram is a reclining posture.

         Kanipura Shree Gopalakrishna Temple, located eight miles north of Kasaragod town, is steeped in ancient religious beliefs and history. It is home to the Krishnashila Idol of Lord Bala Gopalkrishna, which legend says was originally worshipped by Lord Krishna's foster mother, Yashoda, and later given to sage Kanva Maharshi by Lord Krishna himself during the Dvapara Yuga. The sage installed the idol in its current location, where the temple now stands. This temple, believed to embody the sanctity of Treta, Dvapara, and Kali Yugas, was established by Maharshi Kanwa and has ties to the Kota Brahmin community. Historical records highlight that the temple underwent significant renovations in the 10th Century by King Jayasimha of the Kadamba Dynasty, who also administered his kingdom in the temple's name, underscoring its central role in the region's spiritual and political life.
          </p>
          <p>
          The temple's site, in the coastal town of Kumbla on the bank of the Kumbha Hole river, also known as Kumbhini, marks a place of historical and cultural significance. The area around the temple, including the ruins of Kumbla or Kotekar and Arikadi, testifies to Kumbla's historical importance. The temple and its surroundings are rich with legends linking the sage Kanva to the region, with nearby places like Kannur (Kanva Peetah) and Kanva Teertha bearing his name. The temple's Sthala-Purana narrates how the installation of the idol by Kanva Maharshi led to the emergence of the Kumbha Hole river, further enhancing the temple's divine aura. Recently, the temple has seen extensive repairs and renovations, standing at the heart of Kumbla, symbolizing a blend of divine legacy and historical prominence.
