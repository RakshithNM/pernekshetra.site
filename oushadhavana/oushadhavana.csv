Young leaves have tannins, flavonoid, steroid, cardiac glycoside, alkaloids & carbohydrates.","Mangoes, often referred to as the ""king of fruits,"" are not just delicious but also offer several therapeutic benefits. Here are some significant therapeutic uses of mango:

Nutritional Support: Mangoes are a rich source of vitamins A, C, and E, as well as fiber, which are crucial for maintaining overall health. Vitamin A supports eye health and immune function, Vitamin C aids in wound healing and immune system function, and Vitamin E acts as an antioxidant, helping to protect the body from damage caused by free radicals.

Digestive Health: The fiber content in mangoes helps in maintaining a healthy digestive system by promoting regular bowel movements and preventing constipation. Additionally, mangoes contain enzymes like amylases which assist in breaking down carbohydrates, enhancing digestion.

Immune Boosting: Mangoes contain a hefty dose of Vitamin C, which is essential for the proper function of the immune system. It helps in the production of white blood cells that fight against infection, thus keeping the body's defense mechanism strong against various diseases.

Anti-inflammatory and Antioxidant Properties: Mangoes are packed with polyphenols and other compounds that have anti-inflammatory and antioxidant properties. These compounds can help in reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain cancers by combating oxidative stress and inflammation in the body.","Digestive Aid: Mangoes are useful in improving taste and relieving conditions like anorexia due to their Ruchya (taste-improving) quality. They also address digestive issues like constipation and bloating, especially helpful in Vata Dosha imbalance.

Skin and Complexion Enhancer: Acting as Varnakara, mangoes improve skin tone and complexion, while also being beneficial for throat disorders. Their Kantikari quality enhances overall skin quality.

Cardiac Support: With Hrudya properties, mangoes act as a cardiac tonic, supporting heart health and potentially improving cardiovascular functions.

Blood and Muscle Tonic: Mangoes are effective in improving blood tissue and muscle tissue, thus enhancing strength, immunity, and overall vitality. They have qualities that could exacerbate certain conditions like bleeding disorders when consumed in excess.

Immune System Booster: Their Balya (strength-enhancing) property helps in improving immunity and general strength, making them a good addition for overall wellness and vitality.

Nourishment and Nutrition: Mangoes are Brumhana (nourishing) and Tarpana (calming), providing deep nourishment and calmness, making them beneficial for nourishing the body and mind.

Reproductive Health: They are known to improve sperm and semen quality and quantity, thanks to their Shukravivardhana property, supporting reproductive health.

Balancing Doshas: While ripe mangoes can increase Kapha and Pitta doshas, they are beneficial in treating disorders of Vata imbalance such as neuralgia and paralysis. Unripe mangoes have qualities that might vitiate Vata and blood tissue but are also recognized for not increasing Pitta dosha significantly.

Astringent and Pungent Qualities: Offering a blend of tastes including Katu (pungent), Kashaya (astringent), and Amla (sour), mangoes can address various health conditions and preferences, adding to their versatility in medicinal use.
